A player may move a bunny that is already on a Bunderground Station to a vacant Bunderground Station. All bunny movements occur at the end of the current player's turn.<br><br>For example, if Carol has the <a href=\"bunnypedia://card/1309\"></a>Red Centralized Line Bunderground Station #03 - Smile End</a> in her area of The Bunny Circle, then anytime that any player rolls a 3 on the Red die, Carol may move any bunny with an Oyster Cracker or Oyster Cracker Bunny Modifier card from any position in The Bunny Circle onto Smile End. Of course, Smile End must be vacant to receive a new bunny."
